    <h1>GoLoyal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 1, 2025</p>

    <p>GoLoyal (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) connects businesses to customers, helping businesses understand customer activity and rewards, and allowing users to track their visits, points, and rewards from participating businesses.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect certain types of data to provide and improve our services. The information we collect includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, address, and user IDs — used for creating and managing your account, communication, and support.</li>
        <li><strong>Media:</strong> Photos and videos you choose to upload within the app (for example, profile pictures or reward verification).</li>
        <li><strong>App Performance Data:</strong> Crash logs, diagnostics, and other app performance data — used to improve app stability and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device or other IDs — collected to identify your device for secure login and prevent misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The app requests access to your device's <strong>camera</strong> solely for scanning QR codes. These QR codes are used to identify users during business visits and update their points and rewards. We do <strong>not</strong> take photos or videos automatically, and we do <strong>not</strong> collect or share any images or camera data with third parties. All QR code scanning is processed locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain app functionality (rewards tracking, account management, etc.)</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your account or rewards</li>
        <li>To improve app performance and resolve technical issues</li>
        <li>To ensure security, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Data is shared only when required to provide app functionality (for example, syncing rewards or user activity with participating businesses).</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use encryption and secure communication protocols (HTTPS) to protect your data during transmission. Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel only.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Use</h2>
    <p>GoLoyal can be used by children under supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond what is necessary for app functionality. Parents or guardians are encouraged to supervise younger users.</p>

    <h2>Account and Data Deletion</h2>
