    <h1>GoLoyal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

    <p>GoLoyal (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) connects businesses to customers, helping businesses understand customer activity and rewards, and allowing users to track their visits, points, and rewards from participating businesses.</p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>Our app requests access to your device's <strong>camera</strong> solely for scanning QR codes. These QR codes are used to identify users within a business visit and to update their points and rewards.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> take photos or videos, and we do <strong>not</strong> collect or share any images or camera data with any third parties. All QR code scanning is processed locally on your device for app functionality.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>GoLoyal does not collect personal information from your device automatically. Information such as your visits, points, and rewards are stored securely within the app or on GoLoyal servers, only when you interact with the app to participate in the rewards program.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except where required to provide app functionality (e.g., updating reward points).</p>

   <h2>Children’s Use</h2>
   <p>GoLoyal can be used by children of all ages under supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond what is necessary for app functionality. Parents/guardians are encouraged to supervise younger users when using the app.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>
